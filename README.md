This project was for a college course project with the purpose to serve and create a basic webapp (based on given requirements) on a Rasberry Pi that when connected to a router would be viewable on all devices on that network. Port Forwarding was also configured and tested on a router to view the app on outside networks.
This app is a NFL comparison tool that allows you to view basic info/stats of a nfl team of your choosing along with a link to the teams website. A user is also able to compare there selected teams stats with another team of there choosing.
